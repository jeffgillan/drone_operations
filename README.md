Mavic 3 Enterprise

* On one battery, the M3E can map **~1 sqkm**, at 120 m AGL, speed of 15 m/s, 80% forward overlap, 70% side overlap, nadir, single grid. It takes about 28 flight minutes. You would need 2 batteries to ensure completion. For orthomosaic missions, I should fly a double grid.

* At max flyin height I can collect imagery over ~2 sq km per day. This is 200 hectares or ~500 acres. 

* When deleting images on the microSD card, move the images to the trash, then empty the trash. Otherwise, images are not deleted.

* Bring an external power source for the remote controller.
